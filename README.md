# NODE
Experimental self-introducing sensor-control node for smart home system, no predefined device configuration data or predefined control
protocol are used for integration. 

Arduino Uno based esp8266(first version) node implementation sends initial device registration data and sensory feed via HTTP in JSON format, registers itself to the home network.

This repo covers only te low level implementation details of a larger project.
